# javascript-algorithms
Algorithms and datastructures implemented in javascript. The motivation for this project is to get to know javascript as a language, especially the new ecmascript standards.
Many of the implementation uses these new language features that the new ecmascript standards provides.
## Algorithms
### Search Algorithms
#### Binary Search
Binary search algorithm is a algorithm that divides the search space by two for each iteration it runs. More info wil come.
The binary search algorithm is depended on some properties of the inpur elements:
- The input elements must be sorted.
- The input elements must be sorted in ascening order.
##### Performance:
- Worst case: O(log(n)) + 1, Where n is the number of items to search in.
- Best case : O(1), constant time, this could happen if the item to search for is in the middle of the collection of all items.
### Sort Algorithms
## Datastructures
