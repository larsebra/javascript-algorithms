Algorithms and datastructures implemented in javascript.
## Algorithms
### Search Algorithms
#### Binary Search
Binary search algorithm is a algorithm that divides the number of items to search in by two for each iteration it runs. More info wil come.
It has a worst case runtime of log(n) runtime because the number of times that the number of input elements n can be divided in two is log(n) times.
The binary search algorithm is depended on that the input elements has some properties:
- The input elements must be sorted.
- The input elements must be sorted in ascening order
##### Performance:
- Worst case: O(log(n)) + 1, Where n is the number of items to search in.
- Best case : O(1), constant time, this could happend if the item to search for is in the middle of the collection of items.
